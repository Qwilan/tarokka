# Tarokka

A randomized tarokka reading for your online Dungeons & Dragons game, implemented in TypeScript and React. Includes a 3D card effect and a Dungeon Master's guide in a separate tab, so you can present the card tab to players while reading the auto-generated notes.

The guide can be opened with the button at the top right. Refresh the main window for a new reading.

Tarokka is the tarot equivalent in Barovia, the ominous kingdom ruled by the immortal vampire Strahd from his home in Castle Ravenloft. See the Dungeons & Dragons fifth edition adventure *Curse of Strahd* for more information.

***Warning:*** *It goes without saying, but the data file and Dungeon Master's guide contain ***massive spoilers*** for players. A warning modal is displayed before opening the guide.*
